        <h3>IDN Boarding School Student</h3>
        <p>
          Hello everyone üëã, I am Raden Mohamad Fadhel Suradipraja, but most
          people call me Fadhel. I was born in the beautiful city of Garut on a
          sunny Tuesday, June 2, 2009. As the youngest child in my family, I
          have always enjoyed the love and attention from my siblings and
          parents.<br /><br />
          I have a passion for sports and love to stay active. Whether it's
          playing soccer, basketball or other sports, I find joy and excitement
          in physical activities. When it comes to food, I'm a big fan of
          martabak, a delicious Indonesian street food that I can never avoid.
          Pairing it with a glass of refreshing juice would be the perfect
          meal.<br /><br />
          Besides my love for sports and food, I am also dedicated to my studies
          and personal growth. I believe in constantly learning and developing
          myself, whether through academics, hobbies, or new experiences. Life
          is a journey, and I'm excited to see where that journey takes me.

                  I only wrote one school because I forgot the name of the
                  school and the year when I entered.

                  IDN Boarding School Pamijahan Bogor was my junior high school,

                  on those 3 subjects and self-development such as speaking in
                  front of others, confidence, etc. I also learned about general
                  subjects but not too much focus, I learned about math, ips,
                  ipa, etc.

                  given basic lessons from 3 majors in high school RPL, TKJ,
                  DKV. And the final result of all the lessons in IDN Junior
